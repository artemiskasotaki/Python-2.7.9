A robot with two legs moves at a constant speed  and covers a distance calculated from the product of the number of steps 
multiplied with the length of the step in centimeters 
Also it consumes energy equal to 10 Joule for each meter that moves.

Thie program defines the class Robot which contains:
-the number of the steps a robot walked
-the length of each step in centimeters
-the distance in meters
And the following methods methods:
-a method that builds objects of the class and initializes the datalike so : 
  -distance and energy with 0 
  -the steps and the length  according to what it accepts as a parameter
-a method thas displays the data.
-a method that calculates the distance and updates the previous data.
-method that calculates the energy  and updates the previous data.

Fow two different robots "Robo100" and "Robo101"
it calculates all the above data, it prints the number of steps the distance and the energy of each of them.
it finds what robot moved the slowest distance.
